title: About this blog
---

In this blog I will explore topics in computer science, machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and perhaps some philosophical ponderings. The content will mostly depend on what I find interesting at the moment. The purpose is to show intersting algorithms and methods in mathematics, and at the same time be a chance for me to dive deeper into the topics and cement my own understanding of them.

A big inspiration for this blog is Jeremy Kun's blog "Math âˆ© Programming". It is great! So you won't regret ceckingit out.
My blog will in some ways be similar to it. I will cover similar topics in a similar manner, but will try to bring my own take on the subjects.
